                <p class="text-secondary">Open source projects have complete development histories, including who made modifications, what changes were made, and who reviewed the code. The goal of this project was to read, tidy up, and visualize a real-world Scala project repository that included data from both a version control system (Git) and a project hosting site (GitHub). Scala is a mature language with about 30,000 commits and a ten-year history to determine who has had the biggest influence on its development and who are the experts.</p>
