                <p class="text-secondary">The Nobel Prize isÂ the most well-known scientific award in the world. It is awarded to scientists and scholars in the fields of chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace every year. The first Nobel Prize was given out in 1901, and it was Eurocentric and male-focused at the time, but it is no longer biased in any way. Isn't that true? <br>

                     This project, on the other hand, will find out! What are the distinguishing traits of the prize winners? Which country is the most likely to acquire it? Is there anyone who has gotten it twice?</p>
