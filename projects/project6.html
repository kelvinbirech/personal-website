                <p class="text-secondary">A large number of credit card applications are received by commercial banks. Many of them are turned down for a variety of reasons, such as large debt balances, insufficient income, or too many inquiries on a person's credit report. Manually assessing these programs is tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone (and time is money!). Fortunately, with the use of machine learning, this work can be automated, and almost every commercial bank does so nowadays. This project uses machine learning techniques to create an automatic credit card approval predictor, similar to what real banks use.</p>
